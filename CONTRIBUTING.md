## 📏 Coding Standards

Please read our [Coding Standards](docs/development/coding-standards.md) for detailed guidelines.

### Quick Summary

- **TypeScript** — Use TypeScript for all code
- **Formatting** — Use Prettier (config included)
- **Linting** — Use ESLint (config included)
- **Components** — Follow Svelte best practices
- **Testing** — Write tests with Vitest
- **Documentation** — Comment complex logic

### Code Style

```typescript
// Use meaningful variable names
const shipCoordinates: Coordinate[] = [];

// Use explicit types for function signatures
function placeShip(board: Board, ship: Ship, position: Coordinate): Board {

}

// Use async/await over Promise chains
async function fetchGameState(): Promise<GameState> {
  // implementation
}
